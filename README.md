## Prerequisites

- **Basic Web Server Concepts**: Ensure you have a fundamental understanding of web server concepts, including HTTP, virtual hosts, and server configurations.
- **Linux Command Line Familiarity**: Be comfortable using the Linux command line, as most NGINX installations and configurations are performed through the terminal.
- **NGINX Installed**: Have NGINX installed on your server. You can set up a virtual machine or use a cloud instance for this purpose. Refer to the [official NGINX documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) for installation instructions.
- **Text Editor**: Have a text editor installed on your server for editing NGINX configuration files. Popular choices include nano, vim, or Visual Studio Code.
- **Server Access**: Ensure you have access to a server with the necessary permissions to install and configure software. If using a virtual machine or a cloud instance, make sure you can connect to it securely.
- **Internet Connection**: A stable internet connection is required to download and install NGINX packages, explore documentation, and potentially access additional resources during the labs.
- **Basic Networking Knowledge**: Understand basic networking concepts, including IP addresses, ports, and domain names, as they play a crucial role in NGINX configurations.
